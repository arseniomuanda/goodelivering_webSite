                    <h3>Company history:</h3>
                    <p>During 2016 our company started looking at the changes in the lawswithin Angola and how companies
                        were encouraged to use local suppliers. Oil majors stated that they could not use local companies as
                        these companies did not have the skills set to support their business approach. There were elements of
                        truth to statements and a large number of Angolans went to work for oil majors in order to understand
                        how these companies function and how they procure international. We subsequently opened an office
                        in Namibia and South Africa to allow us to procurewithin the SADC region. We kept the
                        relationship with key suppliers in place and decided that our company will be built on providing the
                        critical link between internationalsuppliers and local procurement history.</p>
